                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The fish may be marinated a day in advance; after about 4 hours, when the fish is "cooked," drain it so that it won't become too tangy. For the freshest taste, add the veggies and flavorings to the fish no more than a couple of hours before serving.</li>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, lime juice, and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to float freely; too little juice means unevenly "cooked" fish. Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Drain in a colander.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, olives, and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange juice or sugar. Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately.</li>
                    <li>Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.</li>
                </ol>
